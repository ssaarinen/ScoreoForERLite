# ScoreO / Rogaining extension for EResults Lite

This project is an extension for [EResults Lite (v4)](https://www.oriento.fi/eresults/lite) that adds support for Score-O and Rogaining events. 
It allows you to manage and process results for these types of orienteering events with the help of EResults Lite. Integration between the two 
independent programs is accomplished by this extension reading the competition data from EResults Lite, processing it according to ScoreO and 
Rogaining rules. It can be used to view results in real-time while taking results via EResults Lite and also to generate final results after the
event.
